# LLA Finals Analysis Challenge

## Objective
Develop analytical talent for the Latam esports scene

## What is or will be in this repo

I'm writing this way before finishing to upload stuff sorry.
### Scripts
Python 3-based web scraping tools for Gamepedia picks & bans pages, champion stats pages and playerstats pages.

How can you run them?
Have a python 3 installation
Have pandas, bs4 (BeautifulSoup4) and Selenium installed (pip install or conda install, you know the drill).

### Datasets
In case you prefer working with R or any other tool, datasets created with the python tool are provided in the datasets folder. These are only for major regions. If you want data from other regions, feel free to use the tool accordingly.

## What I want you to provide
An in-depth predictive analysis for the LLA 2020 spring split finals. 

A zip file or link to github repo on my email (santiago@chnn.xyz) containing your code (as documented as possible) and everything needed to run it. A report document (pdf/powerpoint) is also required (data presentation is key).

## What tools can I use
